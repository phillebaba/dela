Kubernetes controller to share Secrets between namespaces.

## Background
Within Kubernetes, a Pod can only read a Secret that exists within the same Namespce as itself. There are probably many reasons for this, one being security concerns. This limitations can create pain points, as teams may want to share Secrets between each other, but they only have access to their own Namespaces. Dela is a proposed solution to the problem, by allowing specific Secrets to be shared from a source Namespace to be shared with a destination Namespace.

Dela works by creating an Intent in the source Namespace and a Request in the destination Namespace. The Intent defines which Secret should be shared. The Request defines which Intent to copy the secret from. The architecture allows a security model where a Secret can only be shared if that explicitly the intent.

## Install
Easiest way is to add a git reference in your `kustomization.yaml` file.
```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
- github.com/phillebaba/dela//config/default
```

Or you can add the CRD and Deploy the controller in your cluster manually.
```bash
kustomize build config/default | kubectl apply -f -
```

## How to use
First create a Secret and a Intent that references the Secret in one Namespace. Note the `namespaceWhitelist` field that indicates which Namespaces are whitelisted to create a request for the intent.
```yaml
apiVersion: dela.phillebaba.io/v1alpha1
kind: Intent
metadata:
  name: main
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  secretName: main
  namespaceWhitelist:
  - ns2
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: main
  namespace: ns1
stringData:
  foo: bar
```

Then create a Request that references the Intent in another Namespace.
```yaml
apiVersion: dela.phillebaba.io/v1alpha1
kind: Request
metadata:
  name: main
  namespace: ns2
spec:
  intentRef:
    name: main
    namespace: ns1
  secretMetadata:
    name: main
```

This should now result in an identical Secret in the Second Namespace.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: main
  namespace: ns1
stringData:
  foo: bar
```

## FAQ
**Will my Secret copy be deleted if I delete the Intent or source Secret?**
No. It could cause problems with Pods that depend on the Secret. Additionally the cat is already out of the bag so deleting the Secret would not make anything more secure. If a Secret was accidentally shared it should rather be rotated.

**Will my Secret copy be deleted if the namespace whitelist changes?**
No. See the previous answer for the reason why. The one caveat is that the Secret copy will not be updated if the source Secret changes.

**Will my Secret copy inherit any metadata?**
No. To simplify the workflow the Secret copy will not inherit any metadata. This means that the Request is required to specify the name of the Secret copy.
